I build applications using Laravel, React, React Native, Next.js, and
modern JavaScript technologies. I focus on accessibility, performance,
and maintainable code. I enjoy solving problems and continuously
learning to improve my skills. Outside of development, I enjoy
exploring new ideas and technologies.
